Python implementation of SO2, SE2, SO3, and SE3 matrix Lie groups using numpy

To install, `cd` into the repository directory (the one with `setup.py`) and run:
```
pip install -e .
```
The `-e` flag tells pip to install the package in-place, which lets you make changes to the code without having to reinstall every time.
